Nuxt + Express
===========

Basic samples creating a Nuxt application with Express.

Dependencies
==========
* [nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) - A framework for creating Universal Vue.js Applications.
* [exprerss](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
* [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) -Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js)
* [cross-env](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env) - Run scripts that set and use environment variables across platforms

Notes
==========

1. During the development, use: `$ npm run dev`

2. [backpack](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack) is used to watch and build the application, so you can use the latest ES6 features (module syntax, async/await, etc.).
